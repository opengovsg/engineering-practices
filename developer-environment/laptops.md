# Laptops

OGP team members are typically issued with macOS machines for development work.

We currently do not run any enforcement software on these laptops, but OGP officers are expected to adhere to the following.

## Software installation policy

**Always install software from official sources.**

OGP officers should never install any software outside of official distribution channels.
This includes (but is not limited to) pirated or "cracked" software, as well as poor practices such as
installing from thumbdrives lying around the office.

Officers who violate this policy will be required to reset their personal credentials and perform an OS re-install.

Use of the `homebrew` package manager may occasionally be necessary to install certain programs as part of their development work.
This is acceptable, although officers should always prefer to use official channels (e.g. App Store, official website).

## Government Standard Image Build (GSIB)

Some officers are issued GSIB laptops, in addition to their macOS machines.
These are corporate machines issued by GovTech, and may be necessary for uses such as attending meetings.

Officers who require their use should approach People Ops.
