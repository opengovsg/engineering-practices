# Release practices

We adhere to the following production release practices:

1. only run production modifications during office hours (unless hotfixing or some other form of emergency)
2. inform the project team via the appropriate Slack project channel

Examples include

1. Code deployments
2. Infrastructure changes
3. Database migrations

If a production modification requires a high-risk change (e.g. running database migration scripts), have at least two pairs of eyes looking at the change.
